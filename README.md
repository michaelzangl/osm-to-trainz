# OSM to Trainz
Convert a OSM map to a trainz railway simulator landscape. That way, you can drive through the landscape.

Trainz is a railway simulator.

This project was tested using Trainz2012. It is not maintained and can be considered experimental. But it worked and produced driveable results.
